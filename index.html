        <h2 id="aboutme">A little about me</h2>
        <p class="aboutme">I am extremely proficient in HTML5, CSS3, and DevOps.
          Building websites with responsive design and elegant features is something
          I thoroughly enjoy. Building basic blogs and landing pages is a simple
          task as well as web sites with more features such as, a shopping cart
          and checkout, user accounts, forums, and more! <br> <br>
          One of my favorite things is taking advantage of the power of scripting
          languages like Python and JavaScript. If you would like a simple script
          that just runs on the command line then I am sure I could put together
          something that exceeds your expectations. I have experience building
          Graphical User Interfaces to make it easier for users to interact with my
          programs and love taking something from concept to finished product.<br><br>
          One of my areas of expertise is Ecommerce, I have managed a multi million
          dollar Amazon  Seller account and was instrumental in bringing its revenue
          to 7 figures a year. I have built multiple applications for inventory
          management, task automation, inventory and sales analysis, and scheduling
          management. I understand what goes into managing an Ecommerce business
          and how processes help achieve maximum efficiency.<br><br>
          Over all I am a very hard working and detail oriented person and enjoy the
          different jobs that freelancing provides. I look forward to invitations
          for all different types of jobs and I am available 7 days a week so do not
          hesitate to reach out!
